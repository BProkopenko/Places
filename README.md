# Web application for displaying some favorite/popular places

Task description:

Create a web application for displaying some favorite/popular places. There are the following features:

Landing page
A landing page should display the list of places (a picture, a name and a very short description). The styles for places should be similar to the given example. You can use a constant size for each place (block) though, just try to reproduce the same UI styles.
Access to the landing page should be public (no sign in require). So the list of places is the first feature that should be implemented in the application.

A new places
In order to add a new place any user can create a new place. A place has a name, a short description and a picture. Please put a button to create a new place in the top of the page. Clicking upon the button a pop-up (modal) appears where a user can enter the details required for creation of a place. 

Authenticated access
Change the behaviour so only an authenticated user can create a new place. Once a user clicks upon the button, the user is invited to sign up (or log in), like on the following mock-up. 
If a user wants to log in, then the following UI should be used.

After a user logs in (or sings up) the user should be allowed to create a new place.

Likes
An authenticated user can like/unlike the place. The total amount of likes should be displayed for each place.
